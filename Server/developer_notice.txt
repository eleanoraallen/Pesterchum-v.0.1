To whom it may concern,

Hello. If you are reading this, it means you are using my
instant messenger program. Why you happen to have decided
to use a barely functional and entirely unsafe piece of
software based on a fictional program from a web comic when
you have literally thousands of other options available to
you is beyond me. Assuming that you never figure out how
shoddy this all really is and assuming that I can find the 
time, I might post relevant information about updates and 
things like that here. So stay tuned. 

Yours,
- PCD
